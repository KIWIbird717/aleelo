	"explanatory_dialog_emotion_anger_description": "We feel anger when we encounter an obstacle and when we run out of gummy bears. This feeling arises from obstacles in the way of our goals. Anger provokes us to attack the obstacle or to eliminate its cause.  \n\nThere are times when anger is caused by frustration. If there is a desire, but it is not granted, something is blocking it - a conflict of desires, moral restrictions, fears and the position of the Moon and the Sun in the wrong sign of the zodiac.\n\nAnger can be healthy and destructive. Healthy anger doesn't hurt you or the people around you. A burst of anger can sometimes make the mind more focused, give you a burst of energy, help you achieve what you want and call in sick. Destructive anger can hurt yourself and others.\n \nThe best time to show anger is in the moment. The habit of holding back anger increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, shortens life and the number of your ribs.\n\nIn a state of anger, we are able to think outside the box, so this energy can be channeled into changes in our lives and expanded health insurance. Anger is a powerful energy that, when curbed, makes us stronger.",

	"explanatory_dialog_emotion_sadness_description": "Sadness helps you come to terms with what has already happened, gives you a chance to review your life and motivates you to cut your hair. Sadness helps you say goodbye to the past, wrap things up, and find beautiful quotes to sign the picture in which you're looking in the distance dramatically. To move into effective action and begin to change the situation, you must first see it and accept it. \nTears are a natural way of clearing and living with grief, pain and longing. It's important to let your feelings out, because unrelived sadness can turn into depression and sad statuses on social media.\n\nHow do you deal with sadness? Grab some friends and spend two days at a bar, watch all the \"Kill Bill\" episodes and order a lot of food. The natural expression of sadness is tears, all stages of grieving and sharpening knives.\n\nOn a conscious level, accept the things that can't be changed and reconsider your attitude. It is important to understand that sadness, pain and instagram stories with tears are temporary. Resource of hope, patience and acceptance come through this.\nAnd to get through a difficult experience, ask for support from loved ones.",
